AR Social Practice Companion Demo

Problem
For people with social anxiety or neurodivergence, social interaction can be stressful and hard to practice safely.

Existing methods like role-play, scripted videos, or traditional chatbots often:

Feel artificial or disconnected from real life
Lack emotional realism
Do not allow practice in real-world contexts
Yet, exposure and rehearsal are proven methods for building confidence and social competence.

Solution
This demo app uses augmented reality and conversational AI to create a safe, realistic environment where users can rehearse social interactions without real-world consequences.

Current Features:

Place an AI companion in your environment (AR or desktop visualization)
Speak naturally to the AI by pressing the spacebar on your laptop
AI responds with realistic speech using ElevenLabs
Conversation logic and understanding powered by Google Cloud API
The goal is to make social practice feel human, contextual, and repeatable.

Demo Scope
This repository demonstrates a single, controlled interaction flow to showcase the core concept:

User places the AI companion in the scene
User presses spacebar to talk
AI responds naturally using text-to-speech
Feedback is generated after the interaction
The demo focuses on clarity, polish, and emotional realism over breadth or full production features.

Tech Stack
Unity (Desktop/Mobile AR)
AR Foundation
ElevenLabs API – speech-to-text & text-to-speech
Google Cloud API – conversational logic and understanding
Architecture Overview
Voice input captured when the spacebar is pressed
Speech is transcribed
Transcription sent to Google Cloud API to generate AI response
Response converted to natural speech with ElevenLabs and played through the AI companion
Why AR / Desktop Interaction?
Unlike traditional chat interfaces, this setup allows users to:

Practice in a realistic or contextual environment
Maintain spatial awareness and eye-line (if using AR)
Rehearse social interactions safely on a laptop
This makes practice more transferable to real-life situations.

Future Work
Multiple social scenarios (interviews, small talk, presentations)
Personalized difficulty and feedback based on user progress
Real-time emotion and tone analysis
Full session summaries and highlight reels
Accessibility features for neurodivergent users
Hackathon Note
This project was built during a hackathon and demonstrates a strong core concept and interaction flow rather than full production readiness. The demo prioritizes user experience, clarity, and realism over feature breadth.

Team
Built by a team of students exploring the intersection of augmented reality, AI, and mental health.
